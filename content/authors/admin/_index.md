awards:
  - title: Silver Medal of the 20th Internationally Genetic Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition
    url: https://igem.org/
    certificate_url: https://projects.igem.org/2023/sustech-oce
    date: '2023-11-05'
    awarder: iGEM Foundation
    icon: iGEM
    summary: |
      The silver medal is awarded to teams that achieve engineering success and complete human practice, and the excellence in model means it achieved the gold medal standard with the following rubrics:

      · The modeling is impressive overall

      · The model help the team understand a part, device, or system

      · Use measurements of a part, device, or system to develop the model
      
      · Provide a good example of modeling approach for others
      
    # During the six months, I led the modeling team conducting domain research, selecting technical routes, and collaborating with the experimental team to perform experimental validation, modeling, and prediction. The competition taught me to cooperate with people from different backgrounds and honed my ability to quickly enter unfamiliar fields and identify suitable research questions.
  - title: Meritorious Winner of Interdisplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM)

    summary: |
      The Meritorious Winner is awarded to the top 10% of teams whose solution report was excellent in many aspects of modeling and problem-solving, analysis, conclusions, and communication. The report addressed all requirements in a clear, well-supported, well-organized, and well-presented manner.

    # From the competition, apart from the data collecting and cleaning, I learned how to identify the pivotal problem and select a suitable model through problem reduction. The process of using simulation annealing to predict the crime on World Bank and GIS data with R is facinating.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
